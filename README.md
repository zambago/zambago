Senior Product Manager @ Peach Payments | Co-founder @ [Zuru](https://www.tryzuru.com/)

I sit at the intersection of African Fintech and Global Travel. My mission is to build digital tools that empower African businesses to scale, moving them away from manual administration and toward global visibility through smart payment and booking technology.

🚀 What I’m Up To
- Senior Product Manager (Payments) @ Peach Payments: Leading the evolution of payment products and integrations. I focus on building seamless checkout experiences and expanding the Peach Payments Switch ecosystem.

- Co-founder @ Zuru: We’re building the digital backbone for African tour operators. By combining payment innovation with intelligent booking tech, we help local operators streamline their operations and reach a global audience.

🛠️ Domain Expertise & Technical Focus
- I specialise in building and scaling complex payment infrastructures and e-commerce ecosystems.

🌍 Impact & Community
- I’m a proud member of [Darkies in Tech](https://www.darkiesintech.com/), contributing to a community that's shaping the future of the African tech landscape. I believe that by simplifying the "how" of payments, we unlock the "why" of African entrepreneurship.
